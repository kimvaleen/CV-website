        <h2>üìú Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I am a motivated 24-year-old Biomedical Engineering Master's student at Aalto University, passionate about leveraging technology to drive
          advancements in healthcare. Currently, I am gaining valuable experience as a Software Development intern at GE Healthcare, where I am
          actively involved in developing carbon-dioxide sensor software using C++. With over a year of experience as a research assistant in the
          Department of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering at Aalto, I have honed my skills in back-end development, primarily utilizing Python
          and C++, to advance TMS-EEG software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I recently participated in an intensive health tech course, collaborating with a talented group of students to innovate a wellbeing product.
          This experience further fueled my desire to contribute to the healthcare industry and address challenges through innovative technological solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Driven by a deep curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and making a positive impact within the healthcare domain.
          With a strong foundation in biomedical engineering and a passion for problem-solving, I am excited to explore new opportunities and drive meaningful advancements in 
          technology.
