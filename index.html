        <h2>üìú Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I am a 24-year-old Biomedical Engineering Master's student at Aalto
          University. I work as a research assistant doing back-end development in
          Python and C++ for TMS-EEG applications in the Department of Neuroscience
          and Biomedical Engineering at Aalto. As an employee, I am diligent,
          responsible, and reliable. I have a deep desire to learn and improve the
          healthcare domain. A saying passed on in my family for generations solidifies
          my attitude towards work: Work, that deserves to be done, deserves to be
          well done.
