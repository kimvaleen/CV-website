        <h2>üìú Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I am a 24-year-old Biomedical Engineering Master's student at Aalto
          University. Currently, I am a Software Development intern at GE Healthcare working on carbon-dioxide sensor software in C++.
          I have over a year of experience as research assistant doing back-end development in
          Python and C++ for TMS-EEG applications in the Department of Neuroscience
          and Biomedical Engineering at Aalto. I have innovated a wellbeing product with a group of students as part
          of a rigorous health tech course.

        <h2>üèÜ Projects</h2>
        <h3>Innovation challenge</h3>
        <p>
          In a six-week group project, we developed YouBetterTrain, a new product for Gluce, a German company.
          Our journey involved extensive research, interviews with experts, creating business and pricing models,
          competitor analysis, market research, customer identification, and a pitch to investors at Bayer headquarters. 
          This immersive experience gave me valuable insights into health tech innovation and product launch.

        <h3>My own website</h3>
        <p>
          As a hobby, I programmed this website from scratch using three.js ‚Äî a JavaScript library for 3D graphics.
        </p>
        <h3>Author</h3>
        For the past year, I have been writing an autofiction book with a friend of mine. We aim to publish it in 2024.
        <h3>Strategy Game</h3>
        <p>
          I developed my own turn-based strategy game with a graphical user interface in Python using the library PyQt5. The
          game implements the A* Star pathfinding algorithm as well as Bresenham's Line Algorithm for line of sight.
